### Day 1: 
21/11/2022

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** Created a script to automate the readme file formatting | Mathwork's MATLAB Signal Processing Onramp Course | Fourier Transforms with Python

**About:** The script would open a new/empty text file to initialise it and then append "Day {number}:" to it. (EDITED TO ADD: Since then I have redone this for the more viewer friendly UI you can currently see, even so the new version uses the same process)

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** CS50P Week 6 File I/O | CS50P Week 7 Regular Expressions | Codecademy's Learn C Course | Created a number guesser game using C

**About:** I learned how to generate a random number using C (python is so much better for this just saying). Whilst the number has not been guess, allow the user to input their guess and compare against the target value --> equal to, greater than or less than.

### Day 6: 
27/11/2022

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** Amazon Order History Data Statistical Data Analysis

**About:** Wrote a script using Python's Pandas Package which takes in a CSV file containing Amazon order history and calculates the total price.

### Day 7: 
28/11/2022

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** Mathworks MATLAB Fundamentals Course: Visualizing Data in 2D and 3D, Conditional Data Selection | Codecademy's Learn C Course: Loops and Errors, Arrays and Strings | FizzBuzz in Python and C | Rewrote my GCSE Computer Science "Dice Game" Coursework

**About:** Fizzbuzz is a common technical interview question where a for loop will iterate from 1-n (n is 1000 in this case) and if the number is divisible by 3 it will output "Fizz", if the number is divisibile by 5 it will output "Buzz", if it is divisible by 15 it will output "FizzBuzz" and if it is not divisible by any of these numbers it will simply output the number. | When I first wrote my GCSE Coursework 3 years prior I had no idea about object oriented programming. To consolidate my confidence with this topic I decided to rewrite it using this programming paradigm. Criteria: points rolled on each playerâ€™s dice are added to their score, add 10 points if the total is even, subtract 5 if odd, if the user rolls a double they get an additional dice roll, score cannot fall below zero (forgot to add this one oops), person with the highest score after 5 rounds wins (i did 10 rounds, twice the fun), if both players have the same score at the end then they each get another roll until a winner is decided. GOOFS: I set the random number generator to choose between 0 and 6, a dice does not have a zero face.

### Day 8: 
29/11/2022

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** Mathworks MATLAB Fundamentals Course: Review Project I, Tables of Data | Redo of the read me setup script | Find numbers from Fibonacci's Sequence containing all digits from 0-9

**About:** I remade the "read me setup" script in order to provide a better UI / form factor for the text you are currently reading. Also added a second script,  "links.py", which automated the process of setting the shortcut links via iteration | The Fibonacci sequence script generates the sequence and also checks if the number generated contains all values between 0-9. If it does contain these then it gets appended to a list alongside it's term number / index.

### Day 10: 
1/12/2022 (christmas month)

**Today's Tasks and Progress:** Tinkered with my CS50P Final Project | Mathworks MATLAB Fundamentals Course: Preprocessing Data | Codecademy Learn C Course: Pointers and Memory | CS50P Week 7 Regular Expressions: watch.py 

**About:** Prettified the formatting of the comments and descriptions, added file path variables to the top of the file to prevent the filepaths from being hardcoded in; this makes it a lot easier to change them if needed. | Pointer make no sense.
