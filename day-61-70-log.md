### Day 63: 2023-02-23

> ada is atrocious

**Software Engineering Placement at an Aerospace Company:**

Ran a power up test on hardware, showing as a fail on the program but log output says "all tests passed" so I will proceed. <br>
Loaded profile to hardware. <br>
Ran a map load test, one fail then one pass. Not very consistent. <br> 
Instrumentation I added not apparent in log output. <br>
Checked the build output. The procedure I changed is being overridden. `>:(` <br>
Copied changes I made over the the procedure which is overriding; now getting compile errors in the build output which atleast shows me that it's trying to build from the right file now... <br>
Added `Common_Types` import and semicolon after `end if` statement. <br>
Still won't build. <br>
`Cannot assign to IN parameter` ok. <br>
For Ada, `in` parameters are read only, and `out` parameters are initialised to 0. <br>
`in out` should work: "An in out parameter is like an out parameter except that the previous value is of interest and can be read by the subprogram before assignment." <br>
Doesn't work. <br>
*Cry.* <br>
"Prior to Ada 2012, functions were only allowed to have in parameters." <br>
I imagine the version of Ada we are running is pre-2012. I love industry. <br>
Made a local copy of the variable to use as opposed to the passed in value. <br>
`Var_Copy : STRING := Var;` <br>
**IT BUILDS!** <br>
This all took about 2 and a half hours but I smiled so much when it finally built omg. <br>
ada sucks.

Got so excited by the fact that the software finally successfully built that I forgot to actually use the copy of the variable instead of the original and only realised the mistake as a senior was about to go downstairs to production and test it on the hardware oopsies.

Update: Didn't work lol

> Hosted a Makeathon Competition for Engineers Week 2023: This event was the result of 2-3 months of planning and preparation including sourcing materials to provide competitors, co-ordinating with the H&S team, (basic) 3D modelling to design a trophy representing aerospace engineering and a Python script to collate the scores. Then celebrated with a >Â£700 Dominoes order and air hockey with the other YINIs. `:)`

**Software Engineering Placement at an Aerospace Company:**

Trying to build some software which generates flight profiles and it's not working ahhhhhh VAX is old and I dont like it

> " VAX stands for "Virtual Address eXtension", made by Digital Equipment Coorperation <br>
> While they were quite popular in the '80's and '90's, you won't see very much DEC VAX hardware anymore. "

got it working, go me 




### Day 68: 2023-03-07

> 

**Software Engineering Placement at an Aerospace Company:**

Added more instrumentation to the log output, build using VAX machine, uploaded to hardware and ran software load test.




### Day 69: 2023-03-08

> 

**Software Engineering Placement at an Aerospace Company:**

More instrumented runs, changed a delay, now seems to work `:)` <br>
Conduct repeats to confirm its working. 10 software load passes. 9 data load passes, 1 fail on the very last one before we were going to be done with it `:')`. <br>
Run more data loads with instrumentation to check if the fail is caused by a timeout condition. <br>




### Day 70: 2023-03-09

> 

**Software Engineering Placement at an Aerospace Company:**

Data load tests with instrumentation x 30 to give it the largest possible chance to fail. <br>
It failed 4 times. <br>
Fault codes suggest hardware issue, need to source a new box but I'm not sure any are available for a while yay.
